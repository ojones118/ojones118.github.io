## Summary
A novel backdoor named **ShadowLynx** has been observed infiltrating the software supply chain through **poisoned npm packages** masquerading as telemetry utilities.  
The malware blends into legitimate ecosystems by abusing developer trust and leveraging automated dependency resolution tools.  
Since early September 2025, threat hunters have identified at least **27 npm repositories** serving the payload to unsuspecting developers, some with over 15,000 weekly downloads.

ShadowLynx represents a growing class of supply-chain threats that exploit the open-source ecosystemâ€™s transparency as an attack vector.  
Its focus on credential theft and modular persistence mechanisms suggests long-term espionage objectives rather than opportunistic compromise.

## Analysis
ShadowLynx poses as **open-source telemetry and logging plugins**, commonly named with variants such as `sys-telemetry-agent`, `logger-pro-utils`, and `perfmon-lite`.  
Upon installation, it executes postinstall scripts that collect **authentication tokens**, **GitHub access credentials**, and **environmental variables** from developer machines.  

The malware communicates with command servers via **WebSocket tunnels** (`wss://cdn-sync[.]net:443`, `wss://telemetryhub[.]dev`) â€” allowing stealthy, bidirectional communication through corporate proxies.  
Captured data is exfiltrated to staging nodes hosted on compromised VPS infrastructure across **Germany, Singapore, and the U.S.**  

The backdoor features a **modular plugin system** that supports dynamic payload delivery without requiring reinstallation.  
Modules observed include:  
- `mod_sync.js` â€“ uploads recent commits and configuration files  
- `mod_token.js` â€“ extracts and refreshes OAuth tokens  
- `mod_update.js` â€“ checks for new payload versions daily via obfuscated cron jobs  

Analysts believe the projectâ€™s naming conventions and code structure indicate links to a previously dormant actor associated with *Operation WebForge* (2023).

<details><summary>Defensive Recommendations</summary>

- Conduct **manual audits** of npm and PyPI dependencies, especially telemetry-related modules  
- Enforce **signed package verification** using npmâ€™s `--verify-signatures` feature  
- Block **WebSocket egress connections** to unapproved domains  
- Review build pipelines for unauthorized post-install scripts  
- Deploy network alerts for C2 patterns matching `cdn-sync[.]net` and `telemetryhub[.]dev`

<details><summary> Domains & IPs</summary>

- `cdn-sync[.]net` â€” Primary C2 channel  
- `update-sandsys[.]org` â€” Secondary relay node  
- `45.33.67[.]201` â€” VPS staging server (Germany)

<details><summary>ðŸ“¡ Network & Behavioral Observations</summary>

- Beaconing every 180 seconds via WebSocket  
- TLS traffic mimics telemetry sync packets  
- Activity spikes during 08:00â€“17:00 UTC+3  
- Log timestamps rewritten to disguise sequence

## Impact
ShadowLynx compromises pose a **severe software supply-chain risk**, capable of infiltrating developer pipelines and propagating to enterprise production systems.  
Given npmâ€™s global integration across DevOps ecosystems, even a handful of compromised dependencies can result in **wide-scale exposure**.  
The campaign underscores the fragility of trust-based open-source environments and the increasing sophistication of threat actors targeting developer infrastructure.
